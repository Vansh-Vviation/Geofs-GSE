# Geofs-GSE (FIRST VEHICLE TEST RELEASED) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vansh-Vviation/Geofs-GSE/refs/heads/main/Untitled391_20250120183047.png"/>![]()

Hi guys, thanks for checking out my add-on. To use simply paste the Main.js into a tampermonkey file, or into you console, and load the vehicle(s) that yiu wish to use. After that you got to turn must turn off your engines (if you write numbers it manipulates the throttles), and engage the parking brake if you so wish. To add your heading, open the auto pilot panel to get your exact heading. for the lateral and the forward backward thingy. You're gonna have to fiddle around with it to get the proper aligntment. 
This is a geofs add-on designed to add ground support equipment to Geofs.
