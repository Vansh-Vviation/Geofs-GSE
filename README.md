# Geofs-GSE (FIRST VEHICLE TEST RELEASED) <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Vansh-Vviation/Geofs-GSE/refs/heads/main/Untitled391_20250120183047.png"/>![]()

Guys Big UPDATE. I have released the JS code for the european high-catering. THis can be used for both double, and mono-decked aircraft. All you gotta do is go to the "EuroCaterHighTest.js" file and copy-paste it into your console in geofs, rn i dont have a option to close the gui tab so you have to reload to get rid of the gui and the addon ( i may add it within the next few days). After that you got to turn must turn off your engines (if you write numbers it manipulates the throttles), and engage the parking brake if you so wish. To add your heading, open the auto pilot panel to get your exact heading. for the lateral and the forward backward thingy. You're gonna have to fiddle around with it to get the proper aligntment. 
This is a geofs add-on designed to add ground support equipment to Geofs. Code will be released once finalized and working. Please check it out, and let me know about any problems, thanks guys.
